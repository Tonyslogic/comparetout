        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>The cost defines a contract with a supplier. This is also referred to as a price plan</p>
            <p>Typical contracts had both rate and non-rate aspects. The non-rate aspects of of a supplier plan:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supplier. The name of the supplier</li>
                <li>Plan. The name of the plan</li>
                <li>Feed in rate. What the supplier pays for exported electricity</li>
                <li>Standing charges. Annual cost of the contract without using any electricity</li>
                <li>Sign up bonus. Some suppliers provide a monetary enticement to switch</li>
                <li>Last update. Plans change all the time, this helps track the validity of calculations</li>
                <li>Reference. Free text. Can be used to record the source of the data</li>
                <li>Deemed export. Indicates how the total export value should be calculated</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A supplier plan can have multiple rates. A rates tab is needed whenever the rates
                vary by date range or days of the week. The rate aspects of a supplier plan
                include:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Days. The days of the week for which the rates are applicable </li>
                <li>Rates. The start hour, end hour and price per kWh</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the 'Price plan details' it is possible to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Edit the cost (supplier price plan), menu</li>
                <li>Share the cost (supplier price plan), menu</li>
