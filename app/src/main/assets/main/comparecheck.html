        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>You can add or remove entries from the comparison tab using these check-boxes.</p>
            <p>This app works by simulating usage what-if scenarios and then
            calculation the costs for each defined supplier contract (costs). When several
            usage what-if scenarios and supplier contracts are specified, the comparison tab
            can get very busy. These check-boxes control which supplier contracts and usage
            what-if scenarios are displayed.</p>
            <p>Only usage what-if scenarios that have been simulated will appear in the
            comparison tab. Simulations will only happen when required information is available.</p>
            <p>Simulations and cost calculations will run automatically when changes are made.
                Running simulations are indicated by a progress animation at the bottom of
                the screen. Notifications are provided for additional visibility -- useful when
            a lot of simulations are running.</p>
