        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>The goal of this app is to create personalised comparisons.</p>
            <p>There are two components to electricity comparisons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The consumer side (usage)</li>
                <li>The supplier side (cost)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Comparisons can be created for a single supplier with multiple variation in usage.
                They may also be made for a single usage across multiple supplier plans.</p>
            <p>There are three tabs presented:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Tab</th>
                    <th>Purpose</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>USAGE(S)</td>
                    <td>Usage what-if scenario management/navigation and add/remove from comparison</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>USAGE(S)</td>
                    <td>Supplier plan (cost) management/navigation and add/remove from comparison</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>COMPARE</td>
                    <td>Show the results of the cost calculation, including breakdowns</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>At least one usage and one cost must be selected for anything to appear in
                the comparison tab.</p>
            <p>There are several ways to get usages and costs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Load from file (menu)</li>
                <li>Download from URL (menu)</li>
                <li>Copy and existing entry</li>
                <li>Create a new entry from scratch (button, bottom right)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, sharing is possible for usages, costs and comparisons. For usages
                and costs, a json string is shared. For comparisons a csv of all the usages
                and costs is generated. These can be saved or shared based on the capabilities
                of you device.</p>
            <p>Clicking on the table entry will:</p>
