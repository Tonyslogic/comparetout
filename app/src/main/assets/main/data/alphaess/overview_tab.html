            <p>AlphaESS provides access to historical data produced by your inverter. Data needs
                to be fetched before the other tabs are useful.</p>
            <p>Using this tab, you can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Connect to AlphaESS by providing credentials (from
                    <a href="https://open.alphaess.com/login"> AlphaESS OpenAPI</a>)</li>
                <li>Select an inverter registered with the above credentials. All the tabs use
                    the inverter selected here.</li>
                <li>Fetch (once off and recurring) data from AlphaESS </li>
                <li>Cost a date range from downloaded data (needs some 'costs' defined)  </li>
                <li>Remove downloaded data from the database </li>
                <li>Export downloaded data to a file (named for the selected inverter) </li>
                <li>Import previously exported data from a file</li>
            </ul>

            <p></p>
            <p><b>Setting credentials</b></p>
            <p>When you set credentials, you will be presented with a dialog to collect an appID
                and an app secret. Credentials are stored, encrypted, on your device.
                To remove the credentials from the device, set empty values.</p>
            <img src="/res/drawable/setcredentialsdialog.png" alt="Set Credentials" width="300">
            <p>To get these two pieces of information you must
                <a href="https://open.alphaess.com/emailRegistration">register </a> with AlphaESS
                Open API. Registration requires a valid email address, and is a time sensitive
                activity.</p>
            <img src="/res/drawable/alphaessregister.png" alt="Register" width="300">
            <p>Once registered, you need to log in and add your inverter(s). To do this you need
                the serial number and check code from the inverter itself. These are found on the
                side of the inverter, a sticker with barcodes.</p>
            <img src="/res/drawable/alphaesslogin.png" alt="Login" width="300">
            <p>Login</p>
            <img src="/res/drawable/alphaessaddsystemi.png" alt="Add I/II" width="300">
            <p>See the registered inverters, and add more.</p>
            <img src="/res/drawable/alphaessaddsystemii.png" alt="Add II/II" width="300">
            <p>Adding an inverter also requires a verification code that is sent to the email
                address used to create the account. Only inverters that have been added are
                available for selection (SELECT SYSTEM) in the app.</p>
            <p>Finally you may copy the AppID and AppSecret, one at a time, and paste into the
                appropriate area of the credentials dialog.</p>

            <p><b>Fetching</b></p>
            <p>Once you have selected a system, you can fetch historical data.</p>
            <p>Fetching starts from a date specified using a data picker. The app will start
                a background process, 'Catchup', that will collect and process data one day at a time.
                AlphaESS rate limit access to this data, so it can take some time. Progress is
                reported using notifications, and also with status text.</p>
            <p>When catchup is complete, the app schedules a daily collection that runs sometime
                after 02:00 whenever the device is not busy.</p>
            <p>Catchup and daily collection may be canceled by 'STOP FETCHING'.</p>

            <p><b>Export/Import</b></p>
            <p>Using the menu items (Open, Export), fetched data may be backed up for faster
                retrieval later. This avoids loading the AlphaESS servers if using the app
                on multiple devices. It also allows for safe removal of downloaded data if
                storage is an issue.</p>

            <p><b>Selection and costing</b></p>
            <p>'COST DATES' will generate an estimated cost for the selected period.
                This will be done for each supplier plan (cost) registered. Completed
                cost calculations appear under the action buttons. Clicking on a costing
                will display a pie chart of the price distribution for that supplier
                plan.</p>
