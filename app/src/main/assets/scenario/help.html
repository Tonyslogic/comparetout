            <p>This is the one stop shop for all thing usage what-if scenario related.</p>
            <p>From here you can specify the characteristics of a what-if scenario, and once
                simulations have completed, explore the results on a daily monthly or annual basis.</p>
            <p>There are four tabs in this area of the app. The first provides a launch point
                for the usage what-if scenario specification. The other three graphical views of
                the simulation output that help in understanding how the scenario works.</p>
            <p>There are six main configuration points for a usage what-if scenario:</p>

                        can help with the population of this data. Note that this should not
                        include usage of an immersion, or EV. Heat-pumps should as there is as

                        must also have data for the amount of light expected. There are various
                        sources of this data. When this data is present, the panel will have a
