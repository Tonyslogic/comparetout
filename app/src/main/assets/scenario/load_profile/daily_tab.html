        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>The daily distribution tab covers electricity usage by day of week.</p>
            <p>There are two modes of operation for this tab: View; Edit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>View. Displays a bar chart of electricity usage by day of week</li>
                <li>Edit. Provides 7 inputs, one for each day of the week. Each input is a
                    percentage of total usage. You can edit the fields, or use the + and -
                    buttons to increment and decrement respectively. The total is advisory,
                    so don't get too hung up on ensuring it's exactly 100.</li>
