        <p><b>Help: Load profile</b></p>

        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>The load profile is the only mandatory part of a usage what-if scenario. It
                consists of a basic profile, and how electricity usage is distributed by hour,
                day of week and month of year. The idea being that as creatures of habit we follow
                daily, weekly and seasonal patterns that can be used to provide a simple but
                effective simulation input.</p>
            <p>Each year ESBN and the CRU publish "Standard Load Profiles". The standard load
                profiles are a statistical average of all users categorised by meter type. These
                are included as options for specifying distributions. Your basic profile is still
                needed. You can learn more about standard load profiles
                <a href="https://rmdservice.com/standard-load-profiles/">here</a>.</p>
            <p>If you have a smart meter (and do not yet export), ESBN also provide (once
                you register) a Harmonised Data Format (HDF) file from which your load profile
                may be extracted (coming soon).</p>
            <p>In future additional sources of load profiles (inverter data and Home Assistant)
                will be added.</p>
            <p>The profile has only five entries:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Entry</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Distribution source</td><td>Select an option for how the distribution of
                    electricity is specified.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Annual usage</td><td>The typical annual usage of electricity.
                    This should be easily retrieved from electricity bills.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Hourly base load</td><td>Most houses have a base load. Fridge, freezer,
                    standby devices, internet routers, etc. If you don't know what yours is, don't
                    worry the default 300W is about right.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Grid import max</td><td>Most domestic grid connections have a max rating of
                    15kW. If you draw more than this fuses will blow and switches will trip. The
                    simulator uses this to curtail the draw when combinations of load profile, hot
                    water schedule and ev charge schedule temporarily exceed the limit.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Grid export max</td><td>To protect the grid from imbalance, ESBN limit
                    the amount of electricity that can be exported. The limit depends on your
                    connection. In Ireland the normal domestic limit is ~5kW. There are exceptions
                    .</td></tr>
