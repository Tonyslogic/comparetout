<p><b>Help: Monthly tab</b></p>
<div style="clear: right">
    <p>The monthly distribution tab covers electricity usage by month of year.</p>
    <p>There are two modes of operation for this tab: View; Edit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>View. Displays a bar chart of electricity usage by day of week</li>
        <li>Edit. Provides 12 inputs, one for each month of the year. Each input is a
            percentage of total usage. You can edit the fields, or use the + and -
            buttons to increment and decrement respectively. The total is advisory,
            so don't get too hung up on ensuring it's exactly 100.</li>
    </ul>
