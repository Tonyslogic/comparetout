<p><b>Help: Hourly tab</b></p>
<div style="clear: right">
    <p>The hourly distribution tab covers electricity usage by hour of day.</p>
    <p>There are two modes of operation for this tab: View; Edit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>View. Displays a bar chart of electricity usage by hour of day</li>
        <li>Edit. Provides a variable number of input ranges. Ranges may be added or removed using
            the 'Split' and 'Del' buttons in each row.
            At most 24 ranges are allowed. Each range has a 'From' hour, a 'To' hour and the
            percentage of total electricity used in that period. You can edit the fields, or
            use the + and - buttons to increment and decrement respectively. The total is advisory,
            so don't get too hung up on ensuring it's exactly 100.</li>
    </ul>
