        <p><b>Help: ESBN HDF loader</b></p>
        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>If you have a smart meter ESB Networks provide access to your smart meter data.
                This data can be used to generate a load profile or estimate a bill for a
                given period.</p>
            <p>This screen will help you do these things once you have downloaded your HDF
                file.</p>
            <p>There are four actions:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Action</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                <tr><td>LOAD HDF FILE...</td><td>Find a downloaded HDF file from any storage
                    that is normally accessible to your device. Once loaded, other actions will
                    be enabled. The date range found in the HDF file will also be shown.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>SELECT DATES</td><td>HDF files may contain up to two years data. A load
                    profile needs only one. This action allows you to specify the dates to use
                    in the generation of a load profile, or in bill estimation. You cannot
                    select dates that are outside the range in the HDF file, and a status to
                    the right of the button will indicate if you have done this.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>SET LOAD PROFILE</td><td>This action will replace the load profile with
                    data generated from the HDF file. Note that if you already have a solar
                    installation, the data will not be a true reflection of your usage. The
                    HDF file only contains a record of what you imported or exported, it cannot
                    see the load that was satisfied by the solar installation. If there is not a
                    full years data in the HDF file, the gaps will be filled by scaling the total
                    usage linearly, and spreading the added load evenly across missing months. At
                    least seven days are required (in the date range selection) so the hourly
                    and weekly distributions will be OK. You may want to address gaps in the
                    monthly distribution by hand in the load profile editor
                    <p>This option will not be available when launched from the comparison tab.
                    </p></td></tr>
                <tr><td>COST HDF FILE</td><td>Generate an estimated bill for the selected period.
                    This will be done for each supplier plan (cost) registered. Completed
                    cost calculations appear under the action buttons. Clicking on a costing
                    will display a pie chart of the price distribution for that supplier
                    plan.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>HDF files can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.esbnetworks.ie/">ESB Networks</a>.</p>
