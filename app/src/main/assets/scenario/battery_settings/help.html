            <p>The battery is an optional component if you have solar panels.
                The battery stores electricity for later use. Batteries must be configured before
                purchase shifting schedules can be created. Multiple batteries are supported by the
                app, but only a single battery for each inverter..</p>
            <p>In edit mode, batteries can be added (button in bottom right), and deleted (menu)</p>
            <p>The battery settings page has nine entries:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Entry</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Connected Inverter name</td><td>Used to identify the specific inverter.
                    This is needed to ensure that the batteries are charged by the correct panel
                    string first.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Battery size (kWh)</td><td>The usable capacity of the battery.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Discharge stop (%)</td><td>At what point should the inverter stop
                    discharging the battery. There are two reasons to do this: (1) you want to
                    prolong the life of the battery and (2) you want ensure there is some capacity
                    in the battery in case of a grid outage.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Max discharge in 5 minutes (kWh)</td><td>Batteries have physical/chemical
                    limits in terms of how fast they can provide electricity. This value is used
                    in the simulation to determine how much should be drawn from the grid.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Max charge in 5 minutes (kWh)</td><td>Batteries have physical/chemical
                    limits in terms of how fast they can charge. This value is used
                    in the simulation to determine how much should of the generation excess
                    can be diverted to the battery and how much should be drawn from the grid
                    when charging is scheduled.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Storage Loss (%)</td><td>Batteries lose charge when not in use, and there
                    is a cost associated with converting electrical to chemical energy. Normally
                    this is not a large number.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Charge rates @... (%)</td><td>To keep things simple, the battery settings
                    include the Battery Management System (BMS). The BMS has one role in life:
                    to protect the battery. The Charge rates provide a very simple model to
                    describe the behaviour of the BMS at various battery states of charge (SOC).
                    Typically batteries will have charging throttled when near empty or full.
                    These values are used to modify the 'Max charge' figure during simulation.</td></tr>
