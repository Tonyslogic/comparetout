        <p><b>Help: Water schedule menu</b></p>
        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>In edit mode, hot water schedules can be added (button in bottom right), and deleted (menu)</p>
            <p>The water schedule menu provides options to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Edit. Enter edit mode.</li>
                <li>Save. Write changes to the database. Exit edit mode</li>
                <li>Share. Export, share backup these schedules.</li>
                <li>Import. Replace the content of this schedule with an imported one.</li>
                <li>Copy. Copy a schedule from another usage what-if scenario.</li>
                <li>Link. Link this schedule to another usage what-if scenario.</li>
                <li>Delete. Delete this schedule from the usage what-if scenario.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Copying a water schedule means that a new entry is made in the database and the details
                of the source copied. It has the same effect as creating the same water schedule
                twice.</p>
            <p>Linking a water schedule means that a change to the schedule will impact all
                linked usage what-if scenarios. When water schedule are linked, a button will
                appear in the bottom right. Clicking that button will briefly display a list of
                linked usage what-if scenarios.</p>
