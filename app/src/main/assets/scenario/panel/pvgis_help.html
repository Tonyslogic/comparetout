        <p><b>Help: PVGIS data grabber</b></p>
        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>PVGIS is a European Commission tool that amongst other things provides
                infrared (IR) on an hourly basis. You can access the tool directly using
                <a href="https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/">this external link</a>. You
                can read more about the tool at the commission site:
                <a href= "https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/pvgis-online-tool_en">
                    https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/pvgis-online-tool_en</a>.</p>
            <p>As PVGIS has quite a learning curve this grabber uses input location, azimuth and
                slope together with some fixed default values, to collect and convert the IR data
                to electricity generated by a string of panels.</p>
            <p>Data is downloaded from PVGIS to you device. It is stored in the 'Downloads' area.
                This data is not deleted when panels are deleted. The data is specific to the
                input provided. If the same input is provided, the downloaded data will be reused.
                The download status is reported under the input area ('Download necessary' or
                'Data downloaded').</p>
            <p>Once downloaded, the PVGIS data must be transformed and associated with the panel
                string. If the input parameters have changed (or are new), this will be indicated
                by 'DB update necessary' (normally 'Data in DB').</p>
            <p>During download and processing, a progress dialog will be displayed in the middle
                of the screen. On completion, a short message will appear at the bottom of the
                screen.</p>
            <p>To download (if necessary) and update the PV data click on the 'DOWNLOAD AND SAVE'
                button.</p>
            <p>The PVGIS grabber has four input entries:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Entry</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Latitude</td><td>The latitude of the panel string.<p>The app can use the
                    device location to populate the latitude and longitude inputs.
                    Use the 'SET LOCATION USING GPS' to do this.</p></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Longitude</td><td>The longitude of the panel string.<p>The app can use the
                    device location to populate the latitude and longitude inputs.
                    Use the 'SET LOCATION USING GPS' to do this.</p></td></tr>
                <tr><td>Azimuth</td><td>The direction that the panel string faces. This is
                    measured in ° from 0° North. East is 90°, South 180°.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Slope</td><td>The slope of the panels has a significant bearing on their
                    generation at different times of the year. This measurement is the angle in
                    degrees from the horizontal. A flat roof will have a lower angle (e.g. 27°)
                    while a very steep roof may have an angle up to 60°.</td></tr>
            </table>
