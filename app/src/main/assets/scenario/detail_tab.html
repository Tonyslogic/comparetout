            <p>There are three areas of interest in this tab:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bar chart. Displays selected hourly statistics</li>
                <li>Line chart. Displays cumulative battery SOC and water temperature, if
                    selected. If neither are selected, the line chart will not be visible.</li>
                <li>Control bar. Select the date (period) to display and control which statistics
                    are visible in the graph.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> There are 14 statistics that may be displayed for the visible period:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Load. The domestic load.</li>
                <li>Feed. The amount of electricity exported.</li>
