        <p><b>Help: Battery charge scheduling</b></p>
        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>Once the battery is defined, it can be charged from the grid. This is a great
                cost saving option when the cost of electricity varies by time of day.</p>
            <p>If you supplier price plan includes being paid for export, and export rate is
                greater than a off-peak or night rate, then it makes financial sense to
                charge the battery, and sell more excess generation.</p>
            <p>In edit mode, charge schedules can be added (button in bottom right), and deleted (menu)</p>
            <p>The battery charge schedule page has three areas:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Area</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Connected Inverter name</td><td>Used to identify the specific inverter.
                    This is needed to ensure that the batteries are charged by the correct panel
                    string first.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Days and months</td><td>The days of the week and months of the year
                    on which the battery should be charged. All charge times listed share these
                    days and months. Use the button to show/hide this area.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Charge times</td><td>Multiple charge times (From, to and the charge stop
                    point -- a percentage of SOC) can be defined for each applicable day. Charge
                    times can be added and removed. Linked charge times are indicated by an
                    enabled link button.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>The menu options for the battery schedules can be seen <a href="menu.html">here</a>.</p>
