        <p><b>Help: Battery charging menu</b></p>
        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>The battery settings menu provides options to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Edit. Enter edit mode.</li>
                <li>Save. Write changes to the database. Exit edit mode</li>
                <li>Share. Export, share backup these batteries.</li>
                <li>Import. Replace the content of this battery settings with an imported one.</li>
                <li>Copy. Copy a battery settings from another usage what-if scenario.</li>
                <li>Link. Link this battery settings to another usage what-if scenario.</li>
                <li>Delete. Delete this battery settings from teh usage what-if scenario.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Copying a battery settings means that a new entry is made in the database and the details
                of the source copied. It has the same effect as creating the same battery settings
                twice.</p>
            <p>Linking a battery settings means that a change to the settings will impact all
                linked usage what-if scenarios. When battery settings are linked, a button will
                appear in the bottom right. Clicking that button will briefly display a list of
                linked usage what-if scenarios.</p>
