        <p><b>Help: Inverters</b></p>
        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>The inverter is an essential component if you have solar panels and or a battery.
                The inverter transforms electricity from one form to another depending on a
                number of factors. Without an inverter configured, the app will not allow adding
                solar panels or batteries. Multiple inverters are supported by the app. In
                practice you need to get professional advice on a multi-inverter system.</p>
            <p>In edit mode, inverters can be added (button in bottom right), and deleted (menu)</p>
            <p>The inverter has seven entries:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Entry</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Inverter name</td><td>Used to identify a specific inverter when connecting
                    panels or batteries.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Minimum excess (kW)</td><td>The level of clear excess generation needed
                    before battery charging will occur.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Maximum load(kW)</td><td>The output rating of the inverter.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Number of MPPT</td><td>Solar inverters include ports (Maximum Power Point
                    Tracking) to attach strings of inverters. This is useful when you have
                    different strings with different orientations. This is used when attaching
                    panels to the inverter.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>AC to DC Loss (%)</td><td>When charging from the grid, the inverter must
                    convert from AD to DC. No inverter is perfect, so there will be loss. This
                    loss is normally well documented. It you don't know then stick with the
                    default.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>DC to AC Loss (%)</td><td>When providing electricity to the house load,
                    the inverter must convert from DC to AC. No inverter is perfect, so there
                    will be loss. This loss is normally well documented. It you don't know then
                    stick with the default.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>DC to DC Loss (%)</td><td>Some inverters (Hybrid) can bypass AC when there
                    is a viable excess and a connected battery has capacity. The inverter still
                    has a little work to do to match the battery and PV DC and no inverter is
                    perfect, so there will be loss. This loss is normally well documented.
                    It you don't know then stick with the default.</td></tr>
            </table>
