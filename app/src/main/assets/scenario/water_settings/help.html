        <p><b>Help: Water settings</b></p>
        <div style="clear: right">
            <p>Only a single hot water system may be configured in each usage what-if scenario.</p>
            <p>The hot water settings has two areas: System properties; Daily usage</p>
            <p>The system is described by six entries:</p>
            <table>
                <tr><th>Entry</th><th>Description</th></tr>
                <tr><td>HW heating capacity</td><td>How much water can the immersion heat? This
                    will depend on the size of the tank and the position of the immersion in the
                    tank. For example a 330l tank with the immersion half way up has a capacity
                    of 165l. Of course if you have a de-stratification pump the capacity will be
                    the same as the tank volume.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Intake temperature (째C)</td><td>The temperature of the cold water being
                    fed into the hot water tank.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Daily heat loss (째C)</td><td>If no water is drawn, what is the temperature
                    difference after 24 hours A factory insulated tank will lose up to 8째C.
                    Loose lagging jackets more, and an uninsulated tank ,lots more.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Immersion rating (kWh)</td><td>How much electricity will the immersion
                    draw when turned on. The simulation for simplicity assumes all of this will
                    result in water heating.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Target temperature (째C)</td><td>At what temperature will the immersion
                    shut off.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Daily usage</td><td>How much hot water will be used over the course of a
                    day.</td></tr>
            </table>
            <p>The daily usage area cover when in the day water is used, and how much of the
                daily usage (%) is consumed at that time. This allows for different usage patterns
                such as morning showers or bathing kids in the evening. Usage can be added or
                removed.</p>
